              Recognizing Financial Skill Service as a crucial employable skill,
              the National Skill Development Corporation, a Government of India
              initiative, led by CBSE to introduce a Financial Market Management
              course. This joint certification program with NSE began in the
              2007-08 academic year under vocational education at the senior

              In India, where only 3.75% of the population engages in financial
              trading, there is a clear need for financial literacy. It's
              predicted that the field will require around 20 million
              professionals in the next decade, including students, investors,
              traders, job seekers, retirees, homemakers, and retired military
              personnel.
